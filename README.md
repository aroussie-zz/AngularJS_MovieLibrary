This is a project done during my spring semester at the IIT Chicago. This project is a movie library. The purpose of this application is to allow a user to report the movies he has seen to keep them in a library. From the unique web page, the user can manage all his library: He can look for new movies thanks to a Search bar, add a movie he found, see the movies he has already had, update them or remove them from the library. I'm only using HTML and AngularJS. I also used the API of www.betaseries.com to send HTML request and retrieve information about a movie and all the data is stored in an IndexedDB database.

You can see snapshots of the application into the "Snapshots" folder.

!!!!!!!!!!!!CAUTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

As the application is using an IndexedDB database, you should open the application on Google Chrome as Firefox still has some problems with IndexedDB...
